In 2015, I designed a PCB that the way we interacted with electricity devices. This board seamlessly integrated Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling effortless control of electrical devices using a dedicated Android app. The PCB boasted a minimalist yet powerful design, emphasizing simplicity and cost-efficiency. At its heart was the robust ATmega64 microcontroller, serving as the brains behind the operation. The entire system was brought to life through meticulously crafted code using the CodeVision AVR development environment. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the convergence of technology and convenience, showcasing how a thoughtfully designed PCB could empower users to manage their devices remotely and efficiently
